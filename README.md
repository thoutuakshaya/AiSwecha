# 🩺🤖 Health Bot

Welcome to **Health Bot** – an open-source, AI-powered chatbot built during the **Summer of AI 2025 Internship** at Swecha.  
Health Bot is designed to give basic health tips and guidance in multiple Indian languages, while **collecting anonymized, culturally diverse health-related advices** as an open-source corpus.

## ✨ About the Project
-Purpose: Build a chatbot for users to share basic health tips in English or local languages.

-Corpus Goal: Collect anonymized, culturally diverse health tips shared by users, to help train AI models on real-world multilingual informal health advice.
Health Bot is not for diagnosis or direct consultation — it serves as a knowledge-gathering platform focused on community-generated tips.

- **Offline-first:** Designed to work in low-bandwidth or offline scenarios using lightweight open-source AI models.
- **Not a medical tool:** Provides *general health tips only*, not diagnosis.
